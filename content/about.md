# About Me

I started my career as a digital grease monkey, doing the grunt work for companies that had not yet automated the more tedious tasks supporting their business. Getting to see how things run under the hood gave me a unique perspective of how these companies operate. My broad experience includes working for global companies such as Microsoft and Amazon and extends to local business and non-profit organizations such as the Washington State Dairy Federation.

Through out the roles at these organizations I have worn a number of hats including:

*  Digital product specialist
*  Tier 2 & 3 support tech
*  Web developer
*  business consultant
*  Team lead
*  Content manager
*  Subject matter expert
*  Operations manager

My core values are Integrity, Creativity, and Resourcefulness.
